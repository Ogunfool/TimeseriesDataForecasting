# Timeseries Data Forecasting
This repo contains machine learning models for time series data forecasting which includes:  
The single output-multi-step forecast  
The multi-output-single-step forecast  
And single-output-single-step forecast    

The traditional machine learning models used for forecasts (multi and single step forecasts) are:   
Random forest, SVM and Linear regression    

The deep learning neural networks used for forecasts (multi and single step forecasts) are:  
ANN, CNN, GRU and LSTM
